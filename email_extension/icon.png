/* 
Note: This is a placeholder. You'll need to create or download an icon.png file.

For a simple solution:
1. Find a suitable icon (48x48 pixels or larger) 
2. Save it as "icon.png" in this directory
3. Make sure it's in PNG format

You can use free resources like:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://material.io/resources/icons/
- Or create your own using image editing software

The icon should be square and preferably 128x128 pixels for best display quality.
